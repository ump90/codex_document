### Quickstart

Source: [Quickstart](/codex/quickstart.md)

Every ChatGPT plan includes Codex.

You can also use Codex with API credits by signing in with an OpenAI API key.

#### Setup

##### App

The Codex app is available on macOS and Windows. Most Codex app features are
available on both platforms. Platform-specific exceptions are noted in the
relevant docs.

1. Download and install the Codex app.

   Download the Codex app for macOS or Windows. Choose the Intel build if
   you're using an Intel-based Mac. Linux users can sign up to get notified
   when the app is available.

2. Open Codex and sign in.

   After downloading and installing the Codex app, open it and sign in with
   your ChatGPT account or an OpenAI API key. If you sign in with an OpenAI API
   key, some functionality might not be available.

3. Select a project.

   Choose a project folder that you want Codex to work in. If you used the
   Codex app, CLI, or IDE extension before, you'll see past projects that you
   worked on.

4. Send your first message.

   After choosing the project, make sure **Local** is selected to have Codex
   work on your machine, then send your first message. You can ask Codex
   anything about the project or your computer.

   Useful first prompts include:

   - `Tell me about this project`
   - `Build a classic Snake game in this repo.`
   - `Find and fix bugs in my codebase with minimal, high-confidence changes.`

   For more inspiration, explore [Codex use cases](/codex/use-cases). If
   you're new to Codex, read the [best practices guide](/codex/learn/best-practices).

##### IDE extension

Install the Codex extension for your IDE.

1. Install the Codex extension.

   Download it for your editor:

   - [Download for Visual Studio Code](vscode:extension/openai.chatgpt)
   - [Download for Cursor](cursor:extension/openai.chatgpt)
   - [Download for Windsurf](windsurf:extension/openai.chatgpt)
   - [Download for Visual Studio Code Insiders](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=openai.chatgpt)

2. Open the Codex panel.

   Once installed, the Codex extension appears in the sidebar alongside your
   other extensions. It may be hidden in the collapsed section. You can move the
   Codex panel to the right side of the editor if you prefer.

3. Sign in and start your first task.

   Sign in with your ChatGPT account or an API key to get started. Codex starts
   in Agent mode by default, which lets it read files, run commands, and write
   changes in your project directory.

4. Use Git checkpoints.

   Codex can modify your codebase, so consider creating Git checkpoints before
   and after each task so you can easily revert changes if needed. If you're new
   to Codex, read the [best practices guide](/codex/learn/best-practices).

   See [Codex IDE extension](/codex/ide) for more.

##### CLI

The Codex CLI is supported on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

1. Install the Codex CLI.

   On macOS or Linux, use the standalone installer:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | sh
   ```

   On Windows, run:

   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```

   For unattended installs, set `CODEX_NON_INTERACTIVE=1` on the shell that
   runs the downloaded installer. See
   [Environment variables](/codex/environment-variables#installer-variables)
   for details.

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | CODEX_NON_INTERACTIVE=1 sh
   ```

   ```powershell
   $env:CODEX_NON_INTERACTIVE=1; irm https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.ps1 | iex
   ```

   You can also install Codex CLI with npm or Homebrew:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @openai/codex
   ```

   ```bash
   brew install --cask codex
   ```

2. Run `codex` and sign in.

   Run `codex` in your terminal to get started. You'll be prompted to sign in
   with your ChatGPT account or an API key.

3. Ask Codex to work in your current directory.

   Once authenticated, you can ask Codex to perform tasks in the current
   directory.

4. Use Git checkpoints.

   Codex can modify your codebase, so consider creating Git checkpoints before
   and after each task so you can easily revert changes if needed.

   See [Codex CLI](/codex/cli) for more.

##### Cloud

Use Codex in the cloud at [chatgpt.com/codex](https://chatgpt.com/codex).

1. Open Codex in your browser.

   Go to [chatgpt.com/codex](https://chatgpt.com/codex). You can also delegate
   a task to Codex by tagging `@codex` in a GitHub pull request comment
   (requires signing in to ChatGPT).

2. Set up an environment.

   Before starting your first task, set up an environment for Codex. Open the
   environment settings at
   [chatgpt.com/codex](https://chatgpt.com/codex/settings/environments) and
   follow the steps to connect a GitHub repository.

3. Launch a task and monitor progress.

   Once your environment is ready, launch coding tasks from the
   [Codex interface](https://chatgpt.com/codex). You can monitor progress in
   real time by viewing logs, or let tasks run in the background.

4. Review changes and create a pull request.

   When a task completes, review the proposed changes in the diff view. You can
   iterate on the results or create a pull request directly in your GitHub
   repository.

   Codex also provides a preview of the changes. You can accept the PR as is,
   or check out the branch locally to test the changes:

   ```bash
   git fetch
   git checkout <branch-name>
   ```

   See [Codex cloud](/codex/cloud) for more.
