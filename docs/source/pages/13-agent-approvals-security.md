### Agent approvals & security

Source: [Agent approvals & security](/codex/agent-approvals-security.md)

Codex helps protect your code and data and reduces the risk of misuse.

This page covers how to operate Codex safely, including sandboxing, approvals,
and network access. If you are looking for Codex Security, the product for
scanning connected GitHub repositories, see [Codex Security](/codex/security).

By default, the agent runs with network access turned off. Locally, Codex uses an OS-enforced sandbox that limits what it can touch (typically to the current workspace), plus an approval policy that controls when it must stop and ask you before acting.

For a high-level explanation of how sandboxing works across the Codex app, IDE
extension, and CLI, see [sandboxing](/codex/concepts/sandboxing).
For a broader enterprise security overview, see the [Codex security white paper](https://trust.openai.com/?itemUid=382f924d-54f3-43a8-a9df-c39e6c959958&source=click).

#### Sandbox and approvals

Codex security controls come from two layers that work together:

- **Sandbox mode**: What Codex can do technically (for example, where it can write and whether it can reach the network) when it executes model-generated commands.
- **Approval policy**: When Codex must ask you before it executes an action (for example, leaving the sandbox, using the network, or running commands outside a trusted set).

Codex uses different sandbox modes depending on where you run it:

- **Codex cloud**: Runs in isolated OpenAI-managed containers, preventing access to your host system or unrelated data. Uses a two-phase runtime model: setup runs before the agent phase and can access the network to install specified dependencies, then the agent phase runs offline by default unless you enable internet access for that environment. Secrets configured for cloud environments are available only during setup and are removed before the agent phase starts.
- **Codex CLI / IDE extension**: OS-level mechanisms enforce sandbox policies. Defaults include no network access and write permissions limited to the active workspace. You can configure the sandbox, approval policy, and network settings based on your risk tolerance.

In the `Auto` preset (for example, `--sandbox workspace-write --ask-for-approval on-request`), Codex can read files, make edits, and run commands in the working directory automatically.

Codex asks for approval to edit files outside the workspace or to run commands that require network access. If you want to chat or plan without making changes, switch to `read-only` mode with the `/permissions` command.

Codex can also elicit approval for app (connector) tool calls that advertise side effects, even when the action isn't a shell command or file change. Destructive app/MCP tool calls always require approval when the tool advertises a destructive annotation, even if it also advertises other hints (for example, read-only hints).

#### Network access

For the Codex app, CLI, or IDE Extension, the default `workspace-write` sandbox mode keeps network access turned off unless you enable it in your configuration:

```toml
[sandbox_workspace_write]
network_access = true
```

#### Network isolation

Network access is controlled through destination rules that apply to scripts,
programs, and subprocesses spawned by commands. When command network access is
already enabled, turn on the `network_proxy` feature to constrain that traffic
to the network policy you configure.

```toml
[features.network_proxy]
enabled = true
domains = { "api.openai.com" = "allow", "example.com" = "deny" }
```

For a one-off CLI session, use the boolean shorthand when you only need the
toggle, and the table form when you also set policy options:

```bash
codex \
  -c 'features.network_proxy=true' \
  -c 'sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=true'

codex \
  -c 'features.network_proxy.enabled=true' \
  -c 'features.network_proxy.domains={ "api.openai.com" = "allow", "example.com" = "deny" }' \
  -c 'sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=true'
```

The feature changes how enabled network access is enforced; it does not grant
network access by itself. Use `sandbox_workspace_write.network_access` with
`workspace-write` config to decide whether commands have network access at all:

- Network off + `network_proxy` on: network stays off, and the feature does nothing.
- Network on + `network_proxy` off: network stays on with unrestricted direct
  outbound access.
- Network on + `network_proxy` on: network stays on, and outbound traffic is
  constrained by the configured network policy.

Admin-managed `experimental_network` requirements are separate from the user
feature toggle. They can configure and start sandboxed networking without
`features.network_proxy`, but they do not turn on network access when the active
sandbox keeps it off. See [Managed configuration](/codex/enterprise/managed-configuration#configure-network-access-requirements)
for the administrator-side `requirements.toml` shape.

#### Network policy

Domain rules are allowlist-first:

- Exact hosts match only themselves.
- `*.example.com` matches subdomains such as `api.example.com`, but not
  `example.com`.
- `**.example.com` matches both the apex and subdomains.
- A global `*` allow rule matches any public host that is not denied. Treat `*`
  as broad network access and prefer scoped rules when you can.
- `deny` always wins over `allow`, and global `*` is only valid for allow rules.

#### Local and private destinations

By default, `allow_local_binding = false` blocks loopback, link-local, and
private destinations:

- Specific exceptions: add an exact local IP literal or `localhost` allow rule
  when a command needs one local target.
- Broader access: set `allow_local_binding = true` only when you intentionally
  want wider local/private reach.
- Wildcards: wildcard rules do not count as explicit local exceptions.
- Resolved addresses: hostnames that resolve to local/private IPs stay blocked
  even if they match the allowlist.

#### DNS rebinding protections

Before allowing a hostname, Codex performs a best-effort DNS and IP
classification check:

- Lookups that fail or time out are blocked.
- Hostnames that resolve to non-public addresses are blocked.
- The check reduces DNS rebinding risk, but it does not eliminate it. Preventing
  rebinding completely would require pinning resolved IPs through the transport
  layer.

If hostile DNS is in scope, enforce egress controls at a lower layer too.

#### Dangerous settings

Two settings deliberately widen the trust boundary:

- `dangerously_allow_non_loopback_proxy = true` can expose proxy listeners beyond
  loopback.
- `dangerously_allow_all_unix_sockets = true` bypasses the Unix socket allowlist.

Use them only in tightly controlled environments. When Unix socket proxying is
enabled, listeners stay loopback-only even if non-loopback binding was requested,
so sandboxed networking does not become a remote bridge into local daemons.

`network_proxy` is off by default. When you enable it:

| `dangerously_allow_non_loopback_proxy` | `false` | Keeps listener endpoints on loopback unless you deliberately expose them beyond localhost.                                                                                            |
| `dangerously_allow_all_unix_sockets`   | `false` | Keeps Unix socket access allowlist-based unless you deliberately bypass that protection.                                                                                              |

You can also control the [web search tool](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-web-search) without granting full network access to spawned commands. Codex defaults to using a web search cache to access results. The cache is an OpenAI-maintained index of web results, so cached mode returns pre-indexed results instead of fetching live pages. This reduces exposure to prompt injection from arbitrary live content, but you should still treat web results as untrusted. If you are using `--yolo` or another [full access sandbox setting](#common-sandbox-and-approval-combinations), web search defaults to live results. Use `--search` or set `web_search = "live"` to allow live browsing, or set it to `"disabled"` to turn the tool off:

```toml
web_search = "cached"  # default
# web_search = "disabled"
# web_search = "live"  # same as --search
```

Use caution when enabling network access or web search in Codex. Prompt injection can cause the agent to fetch and follow untrusted instructions.

#### Defaults and recommendations

- On launch, Codex detects whether the folder is version-controlled and recommends:
  - Version-controlled folders: `Auto` (workspace write + on-request approvals)
  - Non-version-controlled folders: `read-only`
- Depending on your setup, Codex may also start in `read-only` until you explicitly trust the working directory (for example, via an onboarding prompt or `/permissions`).
- The workspace includes the current directory and temporary directories like `/tmp`. Use the `/status` command to see which directories are in the workspace.
- To accept the defaults, run `codex`.
- You can set these explicitly:
  - `codex --sandbox workspace-write --ask-for-approval on-request`
  - `codex --sandbox read-only --ask-for-approval on-request`

#### Protected paths in writable roots

In the default `workspace-write` sandbox policy, writable roots still include protected paths:

- `/.git` is protected as read-only whether it appears as a directory or file.
- If `/.git` is a pointer file (`gitdir: ...`), the resolved Git directory path is also protected as read-only.
- `/.agents` is protected as read-only when it exists as a directory.
- `/.codex` is protected as read-only when it exists as a directory.
- Protection is recursive, so everything under those paths is read-only.

#### Run without approval prompts

You can disable approval prompts with `--ask-for-approval never` or `-a never` (shorthand).

This option works with all `--sandbox` modes, so you still control Codex's level of autonomy. Codex makes a best effort within the constraints you set.

If you need Codex to read files, make edits, and run commands with network access without approval prompts, use `--sandbox danger-full-access` (or the `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` flag). Use caution before doing so.

For a middle ground, `approval_policy = { granular = { ... } }` lets you keep specific approval prompt categories interactive while automatically rejecting others. The granular policy covers sandbox approvals, execpolicy-rule prompts, MCP prompts, `request_permissions` prompts, and skill-script approvals.

#### Automatic approval reviews

By default, approval requests route to you:

```toml
approvals_reviewer = "user"
```

Automatic approval reviews apply when approvals are interactive, such as
`approval_policy = "on-request"` or a granular approval policy. Set
`approvals_reviewer = "auto_review"` to route eligible approval requests
through a reviewer agent before Codex runs the request:

```toml
approval_policy = "on-request"
approvals_reviewer = "auto_review"
```

For the full reviewer lifecycle, trigger conditions, configuration precedence,
and failure behavior, see
[Auto-review](/codex/concepts/sandboxing/auto-review).

The reviewer evaluates only actions that already need approval, such as sandbox
escalations, blocked network requests, `request_permissions` prompts, or
side-effecting app and MCP tool calls. Actions that stay inside the sandbox
continue without an extra review step.

The reviewer policy checks for data exfiltration, credential probing, persistent
security weakening, and destructive actions. Low-risk and medium-risk actions
can proceed when policy allows them. The policy denies critical-risk actions.
High-risk actions require enough user authorization and no matching deny rule.
Prompt-build, review-session, and parse failures fail closed. Timeouts are
surfaced separately, but the action still does not run.

The [default reviewer policy](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-rs/core/src/guardian/policy.md)
is in the open-source Codex repository. Enterprises can replace its
tenant-specific section with `guardian_policy_config` in managed requirements.
Local `[auto_review].policy` text is also supported, but managed requirements
take precedence. For setup details, see
[Managed configuration](/codex/enterprise/managed-configuration#configure-automatic-review-policy).

In the Codex app, these reviews appear as automatic review items with a status
such as Reviewing, Approved, Denied, Aborted, or Timed out. They can also
include a risk level and user-authorization assessment for the reviewed
request.

Automatic review uses extra model calls, so it can add to Codex usage. Admins
can constrain it with `allowed_approvals_reviewers`.
