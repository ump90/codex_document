### Automations

Source: [Automations](/codex/app/automations.md)

Automate recurring tasks in the background. Codex adds findings to the inbox, or automatically archives the task if there's nothing to report. You can combine automations with [skills](/codex/skills) for more complex tasks.

For project-scoped automations, the machine running the local Codex app must be
powered on, Codex must be running, and the selected project must still be
available on disk when the automation is scheduled to run.

In Git repositories, you can choose whether an automation runs in your local
project or on a new [worktree](/codex/app/worktrees). Both options run in the
background. Worktrees keep automation changes separate from unfinished local
work, while running in your local project can modify files you are still
working on. In non-version-controlled projects, automations run directly in the
project directory.

You can also leave the model and reasoning effort on their default settings, or
choose them explicitly if you want more control over how the automation runs.

#### Managing tasks

Find all automations and their runs in the automations pane inside your Codex app sidebar.

The "Triage" section acts as your inbox. Automation runs with findings show up there, and you can filter your inbox to show all automation runs or only unread ones.

Standalone automations start fresh runs on a schedule and report results in
Triage. Use them when each run should be independent or when one automation
should run across one or more projects. If you need a custom cadence, choose a
custom schedule and enter cron syntax.

For Git repositories, each automation can run either in your local project or
on a dedicated background [worktree](/codex/app/features#worktree-support). Use
worktrees when you want to isolate automation changes from unfinished local
work. Use local mode when you want the automation to work directly in your main
checkout, keeping in mind that it can change files you are actively editing.
In non-version-controlled projects, automations run directly in the project
directory. You can have the same automation run on more than one project.

Automations use your default sandbox settings. In read-only mode, tool calls fail if they require modifying files, network access, or working with apps on your computer. With full access enabled, background automations carry elevated risk. You can adjust sandbox settings in [Settings](/codex/app/settings) and selectively allowlist commands with [rules](/codex/rules).

Automations can use the same plugins and skills available to Codex. To keep
automations maintainable and shareable across teams, use [skills](/codex/skills)
to define the action and provide tools and context. You can explicitly trigger a
skill as part of an automation by using `$skill-name` inside your automation.

#### Ask Codex to create or update automations

You can create and update automations from a regular Codex thread. Describe the
task, the schedule, and whether the automation should stay attached to the
current thread or start fresh runs. Codex can draft the automation prompt, choose
the right automation type, and update it when the scope or cadence changes.

For example, ask Codex to remind you in this thread while a deployment finishes,
or ask it to create a standalone automation that checks a project on a recurring
schedule.

Skills can also create or update automations. For example, a skill for
babysitting a pull request could set up a recurring automation that checks the
PR status with the GitHub plugin and fixes new review feedback.

#### Thread automations

Thread automations are heartbeat-style recurring wake-up calls attached to the
current thread. Use them when you want Codex to keep returning to the same
conversation on a schedule.

Use a thread automation when the scheduled work should preserve the thread's
context instead of starting from a new prompt each time.

Thread automations can use minute-based intervals for active follow-up loops,
or daily and weekly schedules when you need a check-in at a specific time.

Thread automations are useful for:

- checking a long-running command until it finishes
- polling Slack, GitHub, or another connected source when the results should
  stay in the same thread
- reminding Codex to continue a review loop at a fixed cadence
- running a skill-driven workflow that uses plugins, such as checking PR status
  and addressing new feedback
- keeping a chat focused on an ongoing research or triage task

Use a standalone or project automation when each run should be independent,
when it should run across more than one project, or when findings should appear
as separate automation runs in Triage.

When you create a thread automation, make the prompt durable. It should
describe what Codex should do each time the thread wakes up, how to decide
whether there is anything important to report, and when to stop or ask you for
input.

#### Test automations

Before you schedule an automation, test the prompt manually in a regular thread
first. This helps you confirm:

- The prompt is clear and scoped correctly.
- The selected or default model, reasoning effort, and tools behave as expected.
- The resulting diff is reviewable.

When you start scheduling runs, review the first few outputs and adjust the
prompt or cadence as needed.

#### Worktree cleanup for automations

If you choose worktrees for Git repositories, frequent schedules can create
many worktrees over time. Archive automation runs you no longer need, and avoid
pinning runs unless you intend to keep their worktrees.

#### Permissions and security model

Automations run unattended and use your default sandbox settings.

- If your sandbox mode is **read-only**, tool calls fail if they require
  modifying files, accessing network, or working with apps on your computer.
  Consider updating sandbox settings to workspace write.
- If your sandbox mode is **workspace-write**, tool calls fail if they require
  modifying files outside the workspace, accessing network, or working with apps
  on your computer. You can selectively allowlist commands to run outside the
  sandbox using [rules](/codex/rules).
- If your sandbox mode is **full access**, background automations carry
  elevated risk, as Codex may change files, run commands, and access network
  without asking. Consider updating sandbox settings to workspace write, and
  using [rules](/codex/rules) to selectively define which commands the agent
  can run with full access.

If you are in a managed environment, admins can restrict these behaviors using
admin-enforced requirements. For example, they can disallow `approval_policy =
"never"` or constrain allowed sandbox modes. See
[Admin-enforced requirements (`requirements.toml`)](/codex/enterprise/managed-configuration#admin-enforced-requirements-requirementstoml).

Automations use `approval_policy = "never"` when your organization policy
allows it. If admin requirements disallow `approval_policy = "never"`,
automations fall back to the approval behavior of your selected mode.
