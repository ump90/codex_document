### Hooks

Source: [Hooks](/codex/hooks.md)

Hooks are an extensibility framework for Codex. They allow
you to inject your own scripts into the agentic loop, enabling features such as:

- Send the conversation to a custom logging/analytics engine
- Scan your team's prompts to block accidentally pasting API keys
- Summarize conversations to create persistent memories automatically
- Run a custom validation check when a conversation turn stops, enforcing standards
- Customize prompting when in a certain directory

Hooks are enabled by default. If you need to turn them off in `config.toml`,
set:

```toml
[features]
hooks = false
```

Use `hooks` as the canonical feature key. `codex_hooks` still works as a
deprecated alias.

Admins can force hooks off the same way in `requirements.toml` with
`[features].hooks = false`.

Runtime behavior to keep in mind:

- Matching hooks from multiple files all run.
- Multiple matching command hooks for the same event are launched concurrently,
  so one hook cannot prevent another matching hook from starting.
- Non-managed command hooks must be reviewed and trusted before they run.
- `PreToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, `PostToolUse`, `PreCompact`,
  `PostCompact`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `SubagentStop`, and `Stop` run at turn
  scope. `SessionStart` and `SubagentStart` run at thread or subagent-start
  scope.

#### Where Codex looks for hooks

Codex discovers hooks next to active config layers in either of these forms:

- `hooks.json`
- inline `[hooks]` tables inside `config.toml`

Installed plugins can also bundle lifecycle config through their plugin
manifest or a default `hooks/hooks.json` file. See [Build
plugins](/codex/plugins/build#bundled-mcp-servers-and-lifecycle-config) for the
plugin packaging rules.

In practice, the four most useful locations are:

- `~/.codex/hooks.json`
- `~/.codex/config.toml`
- `/.codex/hooks.json`
- `/.codex/config.toml`

If more than one hook source exists, Codex loads all matching hooks.
Higher-precedence config layers don't replace lower-precedence hooks.
If a single layer contains both `hooks.json` and inline `[hooks]`, Codex
merges them and warns at startup. Prefer one representation per layer.

Codex can also discover hooks bundled with enabled plugins. Plugin-bundled
hooks load alongside other hook sources and use the same trust-review flow as
other non-managed hooks.

Project-local hooks load only when the project `.codex/` layer is trusted. In
untrusted projects, Codex still loads user and system hooks from their own
active config layers.

#### Review and trust hooks

Codex lists configured hooks before deciding which ones can run. Before a
non-managed command hook can run, Codex requires you to review and trust the
exact hook definition. Codex records trust against the hook's current hash, so
new or changed hooks are marked for review and skipped until trusted.

Use `/hooks` in the CLI to inspect hook sources, review new or changed hooks,
trust hooks, or disable individual non-managed hooks. If hooks need review at
startup, Codex prints a warning that tells you to open `/hooks`.

Managed hooks from system, MDM, cloud, or `requirements.toml` sources are marked
as managed, trusted by policy, and can't be disabled from the user hook browser.

For one-off automation that already vets hook sources outside Codex, pass
`--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust` to run enabled hooks without requiring
persisted hook trust for that invocation.

#### Config shape

Hooks are organized in three levels:

- A hook event such as `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PreCompact`,
  `SubagentStart`, or `Stop`
- A matcher group that decides when that event matches
- One or more hook handlers that run when the matcher group matches

    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/usr/bin/python3 \"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.codex/hooks/post_tool_use_review.py\"",
            "statusMessage": "Reviewing Bash output"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/usr/bin/python3 \"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.codex/hooks/user_prompt_submit_data_flywheel.py\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/usr/bin/python3 \"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.codex/hooks/stop_continue.py\"",
            "timeout": 30
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Notes:

- `timeout` is in seconds.
- If `timeout` is omitted, Codex uses `600` seconds.
- `statusMessage` is optional.
- `commandWindows` is an optional Windows-only command override. In TOML, use
  `command_windows` or `commandWindows`.
- `async` is parsed, but async command hooks aren't supported yet. Codex skips
  handlers with `async: true`.
- Only `type: "command"` handlers run today. `prompt` and `agent` handlers are
  parsed but skipped.
- Commands run with the session `cwd` as their working directory.
- For repo-local hooks, prefer resolving from the git root instead of using a
  relative path such as `.codex/hooks/...`. Codex may be started from a
  subdirectory, and a git-root-based path keeps the hook location stable.

Equivalent inline TOML in `config.toml`:

```toml
[[hooks.PreToolUse]]
matcher = "^Bash$"

[[hooks.PreToolUse.hooks]]
type = "command"
command = '/usr/bin/python3 "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.codex/hooks/pre_tool_use_policy.py"'
timeout = 30
statusMessage = "Checking Bash command"

[[hooks.PostToolUse]]
matcher = "^Bash$"

[[hooks.PostToolUse.hooks]]
type = "command"
command = '/usr/bin/python3 "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.codex/hooks/post_tool_use_review.py"'
timeout = 30
statusMessage = "Reviewing Bash output"
```

#### Matcher patterns

The `matcher` field is a regex string that filters when hooks fire. Use `"*"`,
`""`, or omit `matcher` entirely to match every occurrence of a supported
event.

Only some current Codex events honor `matcher`:

| Event               | What `matcher` filters | Notes                                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PermissionRequest` | tool name              | Support includes `Bash`, `apply_patch`\*, and MCP tool names |
| `PostToolUse`       | tool name              | Support includes `Bash`, `apply_patch`\*, and MCP tool names |
| `PostCompact`       | compaction trigger     | Values are `manual` or `auto`                                |
| `PreCompact`        | compaction trigger     | Values are `manual` or `auto`                                |
| `PreToolUse`        | tool name              | Support includes `Bash`, `apply_patch`\*, and MCP tool names |
| `SessionStart`      | start source           | Values are `startup`, `resume`, `clear`, and `compact`       |
| `SubagentStart`     | subagent type          | Values depend on the subagent that starts                    |
| `SubagentStop`      | subagent type          | Values depend on the subagent that stops                     |
| `UserPromptSubmit`  | not supported          | Any configured `matcher` is ignored for this event           |
| `Stop`              | not supported          | Any configured `matcher` is ignored for this event           |

\*For `apply_patch`, `matcher` values can also use `Edit` or `Write`.

Examples:

- `Bash`
- `^apply_patch$`
- `Edit|Write`
- `mcp__filesystem__read_file`
- `mcp__filesystem__.*`
- `startup|resume|clear|compact`
- `manual|auto`
